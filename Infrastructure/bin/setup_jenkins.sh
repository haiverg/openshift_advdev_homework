# Code to set up the Jenkins project to execute the
# three pipelines.
# This will need to also build the custom Maven Slave Pod
# Image to be used in the pipelines.
# Finally the script needs to create three OpenShift Build
# Configurations in the Jenkins Project to build the
# three micro services. Expected name of the build configs:
# * mlbparks-pipeline
# * nationalparks-pipeline
# * parksmap-pipeline
# The build configurations need to have two environment variables to be passed to the Pipeline:
# * GUID: the GUID used in all the projects
# * CLUSTER: the base url of the cluster used (e.g. na39.openshift.opentlc.com)

# To be Implemented by Student
